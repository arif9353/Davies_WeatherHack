    Based on the current and forecasted air quality data, and taking into account the user's details, please provide **exactly 16 recommendations** for outdoor activities and precautions with a focus on the user's context:

    - If the user is an **individual** with health conditions (e.g., respiratory issues or other conditions), provide recommendations to help reduce health risks. These recommendations should include steps they can take to minimize exposure to pollutants, stay safe outdoors, and maintain their well-being.
    
    - If the user is a **government official**, focus on strategies or steps the government can implement to lessen pollution in the area. Provide practical policies or initiatives that would improve air quality and reduce pollutant levels.

    - If the user is an **organization**, recommend strategies or practices that can be implemented organization-wide. These might include reducing emissions, promoting air quality awareness, or creating safer work environments for employees.

    Each recommendation should include:
    - A **title** and a **description**.
    - Suggestions for **personal protective equipment (PPE)** where applicable.
    - Ensure recommendations are tailored to the user's health, type (individual/organization/government), and forecasted PM10 data for the next 8 hours.

    The output should be formatted as a **nested JSON object** with two fields: `title` and `description` for each recommendation. Recommendations should be concise and to the point, addressing both **minimizing health risks** and maintaining **comfort** based on the environmental data.

    Example JSON structure:
    {{
        "recommendations": [
